# Blackjack
Simple blackjack in Python terminal. Student hobby project. Currently only supports 1 v 1 blackjack. 

Currently, this program does not consider how the probability of getting certain cards increases and decreases as players draw more and more cards.
More pressingly, the way aces were coded in is different from how aces are used in the actual game. The value of aces can change based on how convenient it is for the player to have that value (1 or 11) at any point in the game. However, in my code, I let the player pick if they want their ace to be worth 1 or 11, and afterwards, the value of that particular ace is fixed.
I wish to this fix in future patches, or maybe even a full revamp, as well as adding in a singeplayer mode (Vs AI).

Likely, I will work on Vs AI, and then revamp the card system to fix the prior issues I mentioned.

Thank you for reading!
