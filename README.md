# Blackjack
Simple blackjack in Python terminal. Student hobby project. Currently only supports 1 v 1 blackjack. 

Currently, this program does not take into consideration the possibility that a player could draw an ace as their first card.
Moreover, we do not consider how the probability of getting certain cards increases and decreases as players draw more and more cards.
These are both things that I wish to fix in future patches, as well as adding in a singeplayer mode.

Thank you for reading!
